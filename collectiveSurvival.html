    <h1 class="title">Mindfulness and collective survival in uncertain times.</h1>

    <p class="footnote">Are you surviving on your own?</p>

<p>In the last ten years there has been an explosion of scientific interest in mindfulness. Mindfulnes Based Cogntive Therapy for Depression (MBCT) was developed around fifteen years ago and was approved for use on the NHS in 2004. Mindfulness is now being provided by more and more health service trusts across the country.</p>

<p>Interest in mindfulness, incubated in clinical contexts is proving contagious. Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Finding Peace in a Frantic World, by Mark Williams and Danny Penman, now number four non-fiction best-seller, has taken the science of mindfulness to a new audience.</p>

<p>We evolved to live in small closely related nomadic groups, living from the forage collected and the game we killed. We lived closely with each other and we survived in groups cemented by close relationships, enmeshed within the web of life sustained by the earth.</p>

<h3>Society has changed. We live longer but we are not happy.</h3>

<p>Society has changed. We live longer but we are not happy. One in four of us are going to suffer from some kind of diagnosable mental illness sometime in our lives. Stress is the number one cause of long-term absenteeism at work and is causing untold damage to our health. We sell our soul to gain qualifications to gain work to pay for mortgages and designer lifestyles. We strive to acquire property and insure ourselves against illness, accident and decrepitude. We live to excess, enacting a myth of lack, in a pyramid of social inequity, consuming resources many times the carrying capacity of the planet. Our children are raised by strangers, our marriages don't last and we are discarded by society in the loneliness of a functionless old age.</p>

<p>Society has evolved since the dawn of history. Small groups of hunter-gatherers spread across the continents. We started to grow our own food. We had more control and greater capacity for food production. We settled. We developed new technology and food surpluses that supported craftsmen, traders, priests, princes and kings. Resources became property and class determined power and status. Warring tribal groups were eventually subdued by empires, out of which Nations emerged.</p>

<p>Hunter-gatherer elders, like elephant matriarchs, carried a lifetime of wisdom and that of the generations who had passed their knowledge down to them. A clan couldn't survive without its elders and the elders couldnâ€™t survive without the clan. Our lives were an enactment of the ecos of collective roles performed by different stages of life. We survived, like the elephants, from day to day. We might have to experience drought or periods where there was no game or little food for forage. Life might be uncertain but we survived sharing what we had.</p>

<h3>The godlike leader became the egoic figurehead and goods, the land, as well as their subjects, became their property. Control of resources and command of allegiance to the leader became a matter of politics.</h3>

<p>When humans first tilled the land and technology, culture and society developed to support larger centres of population, the function of leadership changed. Leaders became dependent on a very different set of behavior traits to the elders of the hunter-gatherer clan. The godlike leader became the egoic figurehead and goods, the land, as well as their subjects, became their property. Control of resources and command of allegiance to the leader became a matter of politics and ruthless action was needed to maintain power and to control the tribe.</p>

<p>For most of us still, we lived in extended families in traditional societies and children were reared as much by aunts, older siblings and cousins as by their own mothers. Extended family networks became castes performing more and more specialized functions in society. But there was little freedom for women and only limited social mobility.</p>

<p>However, nothing remains unchanged forever. Patriarchy has built a new World out of agriculture,industrialisation and the development of a technologically driven communications. Patriarchy has given birth to levels of education, material wealth, longevity, greater freedom for women and social mobility greater than at any other time in history. However, what we have created is unstable. We are destroying the biosphere, have an economic system that is bankrupt and the tectonics of social inequity threaten to trigger tsunamis of mass migration and quakes of political unrest.</p>

<p>Where do we go?</p>

<p>In a time where leaps in farming technology were creating a food surplus and the seeds of patriarchal society were germinating, an Indian prince was shocked to find that people still suffered disease, old age and death. He left his palace and discovered a powerful set of mental exercises, which develop our capacity for mindfulness, freeing us from the suffering we create in our imagination to live fully from moment to moment. Many things may have changed in the last two and half millennia but the basic patterns of psychological distress we experience today has much in common with those experienced by people in the Buddha's times.</p>

<h3>Without developing new ways of managing the impact of modern living on our minds we will continue to behave in ways that feed epidemics of unhappiness and predict our collective self-destruction.</h3>

<p>Without developing new ways of managing the impact of modern living on our minds we will continue to behave in ways that feed epidemics of unhappiness and predict our collective self-destruction. Science is showing us that mindfulness sets the mind free from the destructive psychological effects of modern working life. With mindfulness we can be more aware of what feels right for ourselves and those around us. We can temper the desire to consume and pressure to perform by discovering how to be happy. We can place our energies on improving the quality of our lives and enjoy the richness of simple things. We can better care for ourselves and others, and foster better relationships at home and at work. We find that ethical action doesn't just feel better, it becomes the foundation of good business. We can release our potential to explore new ways of working and living. With mindfulness, we can build a more equitable world and a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>We no longer need the authority of leaders, a priesthood or a class of monastics to educate and enact our mythologies and who control knowledge and resources in a pact with society where we relinquish autonomy to patriarchal figureheads of influence and power. Patriarchal society has created the conditions for the emergence of civil society. In turn, this has released the power of individual self-interest to work for personal reward. Now it is time for individuals to work better together to meet the challenges begotten of self-interest, technology and patriarchal society.</p>

<p>Today, successful business is based on creativity and collaboration just as much as our survival was dependent on these same human capacities at the dawn of time. Psychology is explaining how the mind, evolution has given us, works. Mindfulness is the key to unlocking the potential of our hunter-gatherer minds to use technology within the framework of civil society, to flourish as individuals and collaborate to build a better World for the future.</p>
